# Quarto Book for Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments
This is my learning diary for the Term 2 module, Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments. This comprises of the weekly understanding of the classwork and materials.

I did my Bachelor's in Physical Planning from the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, India. I have some experience in Remote Sensing, but from this module, I would like to learn the basics and technicalities of Remote Sensing, like corrections and Google Earth Engine (GEE).
